## 2.3
Petri net is not bound given that there's a path through which we can generate unlimited tokens.

Since the petri net is not bound, it is also not safe.

The Petri Net is not conservative, since the number of tokens can grow unlimited.

- T1 is L1-live
- T3, T4 is L3-Live
- T2 is special case


## 2.6
The net is not a workflow net, since there is no place where the last output token is put which has no further edges. (i.e. "endstate")
